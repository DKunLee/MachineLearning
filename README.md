## Decision Tree Classifier
This model is the common decision tree classifier that classifies the numerical and categorical data.
Current implementation only has ID3 algorithm with 'information gain' with 'entropy'.

For categorical data:
- I just used the 'entropy' to find the 'information gain' and pick the best attrubutes among the subset.
  
For numerical data:
- I used 'potential split points' to find the best threshold and calculate the 'information gain'. If the best attribute is the numerical feature, then the node save the threshold.
